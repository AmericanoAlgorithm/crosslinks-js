			<p class="faq__question">I want to add a topic, but I'm afraid I don't know enough about it. Am I qualified to edit? </p>
			<p class="faq__answer">Absolutely. You don't have to fill out the entire topic at once. In fact, you can just link to a really good resource that you want to share with your classmates. In that case, you can just add the topic, maybe link to that resource, and leave it for others to contribute more.</p>
