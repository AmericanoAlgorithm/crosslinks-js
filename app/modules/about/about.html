				Crosslinks connects topics you learn as an undergrad at MIT. These connections are called <i>crosslinks</i>. If you're familiar with graph theory, you can think of Crosslinks as a graph: topics are nodes on the graph, and connections among topics are directed edges. Every topic page has aggregated links to good materials that MIT students have found helpful.
